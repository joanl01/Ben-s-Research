Assess how beach nourishment schemes influence macro-invertebrate biodiversity (abundance & richness) 

I have a dataset, that contains 20 species, collected from Beach control, Beach A and Beach B, each from 2 terrains, Dune and beach Here's an overview of the data # A tibble: 180 × 23 Species Terrain Type P1 P2 P3 P4 P5 P6 P7 P8 P9 P10 P11 P12 P13 P14 P15 P16 P17 P18 P19 P20 Sampling Group <chr> <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr> 1 Hannidae sp 1.0 Beach 0 0 14 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 Beach Control 2 Hannidae sp 1.0 Dune 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beach Control 3 scarabaeoidea sp 1.0 Beach 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beach Control 4 scarabaeoidea sp 1.0 Dune 0 0 1 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Beach Control



Thanks for sharing the data structure. It looks like you're working with a dataset of species abundance across different sites (Beach vs. Dune) and with multiple sampling groups (e.g., Beach Control). Based on this, you can perform a PERMANOVA to assess the effects of beach nourishment (represented by Sampling Group), terrain (Terrain Type), and their interaction on the species abundance.

Here’s how to approach the analysis in more detail, step by step:

Step 1: Prepare Data
From the head() you shared, it appears you have the following columns:

Species: The species identification.
Terrain Type: The terrain type (Beach vs. Dune).
P1 to P20: Abundance of species across 20 points or sampling locations.
Sampling Group: The experimental group (e.g., "Beach control").
We will focus on the abundance data (P1 to P20) and how it relates to Terrain Type and Sampling Group in a PERMANOVA.


Step 2: Create Abundance Matrix
You will need to reshape your data so that you have a matrix of species abundance for each sample. This matrix should have one row per sample and one column per species. Here’s how to do that:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(vegan)

# Assuming your dataset is named `df`, and you have species abundance in columns P1 to P20.
# Select species abundance columns and convert to a matrix
species_data <- df %>%
  select(P1:P20) %>%
  as.matrix()

# Inspect the species data matrix
head(species_data)
This will give you a matrix where each row represents a sample and each column represents the abundance of a particular species.

Step 3: Create Grouping Factors
We want to analyze how the Sampling Group and Terrain Type influence the species composition. To do this, you will create a grouping factor that combines these two variables, as these are the main factors that influence biodiversity.

Here’s how to create the grouping factor:

r
Copy code
# Create a factor for Sampling Group and Terrain Type interaction
group_factor <- interaction(df$`Sampling Group`, df$`Terrain Type`)

# Inspect the group factor
table(group_factor)
The interaction() function will create a factor combining both Sampling Group and Terrain Type. This factor will be used in the PERMANOVA model to assess the effects of both factors.

Step 4: Run PERMANOVA
Now, we can run the PERMANOVA using the adonis() function from the vegan package. This function will test whether the species composition (abundance) differs between the levels of the grouping factor (Sampling Group and Terrain Type).

r
Copy code
# Perform PERMANOVA to test the effect of Sampling Group and Terrain Type
permanova_results <- adonis(species_data ~ group_factor, permutations = 999)

# Print the results
print(permanova_results)
Step 5: Interpret Results
The output of the adonis() function will include:

Sum of squares (SS): The proportion of variation explained by each factor.
Mean squares (MS): The mean variation for each factor.
F-value: The ratio of the variation explained by the factor to the variation within groups.
p-value: The statistical significance of the factor's effect on species composition.
The p-value will tell you if there is a statistically significant difference in species composition based on the levels of Sampling Group and Terrain Type.

If the p-value is less than 0.05, you can conclude that the factors (Sampling Group and/or Terrain Type) significantly influence the species composition in your samples.

Step 6: Additional Analysis (Optional)
If you're interested in breaking down the effects of Sampling Group and Terrain Type individually or examining their interaction more closely, you can run separate PERMANOVA tests for each factor:

r
Copy code
# Test the effect of Sampling Group
permanova_group <- adonis(species_data ~ `Sampling Group`, data = df, permutations = 999)
print(permanova_group)

# Test the effect of Terrain Type
permanova_terrain <- adonis(species_data ~ `Terrain Type`, data = df, permutations = 999)
print(permanova_terrain)
Step 7: Visualizing the Results (Optional)
You can also use Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (NMDS) or Principal Coordinates Analysis (PCA) to visualize the differences between the groups:

r
Copy code
# NMDS visualization of species composition
nmds <- metaMDS(species_data, distance = "bray", k = 2)

# Plot the NMDS
plot(nmds, type = "t", main = "NMDS of Species Composition")

# Add group information to the plot
ordiplot(nmds, display = "sites", type = "t")
ordihull(nmds, group_factor, draw = "polygon", col = "transparent", border = "black")
This will generate an NMDS plot that shows the clustering of different groups (e.g., different sampling groups and terrain types). You can further customize the plot to highlight your groups more clearly.

Conclusion
To summarize:

Reshape your data into an abundance matrix.
Create a grouping factor based on the relevant factors (e.g., Sampling Group and Terrain Type).
Run PERMANOVA using the adonis() function to test the effects of these factors on species composition.
Optionally, visualize the results using NMDS or PCA.
This approach should allow you to assess whether beach nourishment (via the Sampling Group) and terrain type (Terrain Type) have a significant impact on macro-invertebrate biodiversity in your study sites.

Absolutely! We can use ggplot2 to visualize the results of a PERMANOVA by plotting an NMDS (Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling) or PCA (Principal Component Analysis) for the species abundance data. I'll show you how to do both.

Step 1: NMDS with ggplot2
We'll first perform the NMDS and then plot it using ggplot2. The metaMDS() function from the vegan package will perform the NMDS analysis, and then we’ll convert the results into a data.frame that can be plotted with ggplot2.

Code for NMDS:
r
Copy code
# Perform NMDS using vegan's metaMDS function
nmds <- metaMDS(species_data, distance = "bray", k = 2)

# Extract the NMDS results (coordinates for plotting)
nmds_data <- as.data.frame(scores(nmds))
nmds_data$group <- group_factor  # Add the grouping factor to the NMDS results

# Plot the NMDS using ggplot2
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(nmds_data, aes(x = MDS1, y = MDS2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Beach control" = "blue", "Beach A" = "green", "Beach B" = "red", "Dune control" = "purple")) +  # Customize colors as needed
  labs(title = "NMDS Plot of Species Composition", x = "NMDS1", y = "NMDS2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
Explanation:
metaMDS(): This function from the vegan package performs NMDS using the Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index.
scores(nmds): Extracts the NMDS coordinates, which are then used for plotting.
group_factor: The factor that defines your experimental groups (Sampling Group × Terrain Type), which is added to the NMDS results for coloring in the plot.
ggplot2: Used to generate the scatter plot, with different colors for each group.
Customization:
The scale_color_manual() line lets you customize the colors for each group. You can change the color scheme based on your experimental groups.
You can adjust the size = 3 for the point size and other plot settings based on your preferences.
Step 2: PCA with ggplot2
Next, let’s run a PCA using the prcomp() function (for principal component analysis) and visualize the first two principal components.

Code for PCA:
r
Copy code
# Perform PCA
pca <- prcomp(species_data, center = TRUE, scale. = TRUE)

# Extract PCA scores for the first two components (PC1 and PC2)
pca_data <- as.data.frame(pca$x)
pca_data$group <- group_factor  # Add the grouping factor

# Plot the PCA using ggplot2
ggplot(pca_data, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = group)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Beach control" = "blue", "Beach A" = "green", "Beach B" = "red", "Dune control" = "purple")) +  # Customize colors as needed
  labs(title = "PCA Plot of Species Composition", x = "PC1", y = "PC2") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.title = element_blank())
Explanation:
prcomp(): Performs Principal Component Analysis on the species abundance data, scaling and centering the data for better interpretation.
pca$x: Extracts the principal component scores (PC1, PC2, etc.).
ggplot2: Used for creating a scatter plot with colors indicating the different experimental groups (i.e., group_factor).
Customization:
Similar to the NMDS plot, you can modify the color scheme, point size, and labels as needed.
Step 3: Visualizing the Results
Both of these plots (NMDS and PCA) allow you to visualize how the different Sampling Group and Terrain Type groups are clustered based on their species composition. You’ll likely see that the different groups either cluster together or show some level of separation, which can give you a sense of how these factors are influencing the biodiversity of the macro-invertebrate communities.

Final Thoughts:
NMDS is particularly useful for ecological data as it preserves rank-order relationships, which is important when working with dissimilarity measures like Bray-Curtis.
PCA is a linear method and works well for visualizing variance in high-dimensional data (i.e., species abundance data).
Both methods can complement the PERMANOVA results, giving you a clearer idea of how the different experimental conditions (e.g., beach nourishment and terrain type) are affecting the macro-invertebrate communities in terms of species composition.
